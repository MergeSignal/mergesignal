# Releasing (GitHub Actions integration)

The composite action lives at `.github/actions/merge-signal-scan/`.

## Using `@main` (always latest)

Many teams use:

```yaml
uses: MergeSignal/mergesignal/.github/actions/merge-signal-scan@main
```

That always resolves to the **latest** action definition on the default branch. Prefer this when you want new summary tweaks and fixes as soon as they land; accept that behavior can change without a tag bump.

## Optional: pin a tag

When you want **fixed** behavior for CI reproducibility, pin a version tag:

```yaml
uses: MergeSignal/mergesignal/.github/actions/merge-signal-scan@vX.Y.Z
```

## Tagging (maintainers)

1. Merge changes to `main` (including `action.yml`, `scripts/ci/render-mergesignal-step-summary.mjs`, and any CLI behavior the action relies on).
2. Create an annotated tag on the commit you want customers to use, e.g. `v0.2.0`.
3. Push the tag: `git push origin v0.2.0`.
4. Optionally update **Getting started** / **README** examples to reference the new tag when you want docs to default to that release.

**Semver guidance**

- **Patch** - Summary text tweaks, bug fixes, faster installs, no input or JSON contract change.
- **Minor** - New optional inputs, backward-compatible summary additions.
- **Major** - Remove/rename inputs, or breaking changes to fields consumed by `render-mergesignal-step-summary.mjs` from `mergesignal-scan.json`.

**Note (trusted engine integration):** Versions after the switch to **GitHub checkout** of the private engine repo removed action inputs `npm_token`, `engine_package`, `npm_registry_url`, and `engine_impl_module`, and replaced registry-based install with `engine_repo_token`, `engine_repository`, `engine_ref`, and `engine_impl_file`. Consumers must rename the dogfood secret to **`MERGESIGNAL_ENGINE_REPO_TOKEN`** and drop npm-package-based configuration. Treat that migration as a **major** bump when pinning tags.

## Smoke test before tagging

From another **public** repository (or a throwaway fork), add the minimal workflow from `.github/actions/merge-signal-scan/README.md`, open a PR, and confirm the **Actions** summary appears. This repository’s [`.github/workflows/mergesignal-scan.yml`](.github/workflows/mergesignal-scan.yml) also exercises the same action on every same-repo PR to `main` (check name **`MergeSignal / Analysis`**). After changing workflow or job display names, update required checks in GitHub.
